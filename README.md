# ENSEMBLIST
### Bringing professional musicians together

## Problem
You have a gig. You need musicians. But you don't know any who will fit the requirements for this particular event. Or perhaps the ones you know are all busy. Or maybe you are new in town and have not built up your network yet.

## Solution
This app will let musicians create a profile and put themselves on each other's radar. Users can create a gig, search the area for the needed musicians, and then invite them to collaborate.

Musicians rely strongly on their network. This app will facillitate the building of those connections.


## First step: Create a Gig

## Filling positions
As you invite collaborators and they accept, your gig page will reflect the changes.

## Invites
Here you can view the gigs that other musicians have invited you to. Once you accept, they with migrate from "pending" to "accepted".
