# ENSEMBLIST
#### <i>Bringing professional musicians together</i>


## Problem
You have a gig. You need musicians. But you don't know any who will fit the requirements for this particular event. Or perhaps the ones you know are all busy. Or maybe you are new in town and have not built up your network yet.

## Solution
This web app offers a platform for musicians create a profile and put themselves on each other's radar. Users can create a gig, search the area for the needed musicians, and then invite them to collaborate.

Professional musicians rely heavily on their surrounding network. This app will facilitate the building of those connections.
